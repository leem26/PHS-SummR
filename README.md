# PHS-SummR

This repository contains the files for the Population Health Science [SummR 2020 website](https://phs-summr2020.netlify.app), 
a workshop held at the end of the summer for Harvard University Population Health Sciences PhD students. 

Files were produced using the `blogdown` package in RStudio, and deployed continuously to Netflify.
